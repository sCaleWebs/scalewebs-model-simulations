Some constraints:\nAll species except basal resources need a link\nmost species will have only 3 connections (ie they eat basal resources)\nfinally, we want to relate a species number of links to the community.\nNumber of links per consumer is :\n\\[\nL_i = (S - 1)p_i + 1\n\\]\npossibly with the constraint that the one link canâ€™t be a cannibal!\nThe probability of a link, \\(p_i\\) is another way of thinking about the degree of a species\nIn our dataset the modal species richness is 3 because most species are detritivores that eat all the basal resources\n\nDo we want to have some kind of.. 3-inflated distribution for our links?\nOne simple way to do this is to allow the node distribution to have an average centered on 3\nThe steps: * find the average p for a food web where most species eat 3 things * let each consumer have a different p (complexify this later) * draw links for each predator\n\n\n\nthis could be converted to the logit scale:\n\n\n\nsimulate incidence functions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
